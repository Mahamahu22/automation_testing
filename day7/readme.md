# Screenshots, Videos & Reporting (Playwright)

##  What I Did
- Created a Playwright project for testing screenshots, videos, and reporting.
- Wrote a test to take screenshots **before and after form submission**.

##  How to Run the Test and View Report

### Run Specific Test with Browser Visible
```bash
npx playwright test tests/day7.spec.ts --headed

## View HTML Report

npx playwright show-report
